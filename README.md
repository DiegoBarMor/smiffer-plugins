# SMIFFer plugins

## TODO
### General
- document the plugins setup, installation and usage

### PyMOL
- default output for smiffer execution should be MRC (CMAP isn't supported)

### VMD
- default output for smiffer execution should be MRC (CMAP isn't supported)
- a "&1" file is being generated at vmd/plugins/noarch/tcl/vmd_smiffer/volgrids-main/run, is it intended?
- installation script sometimes hangs when checking the APBS installation
